Create a list of numbers between 0 and an upper limit, with every succeeding number having a difference of 2 between them.
When the user inputs a random number to be searched the program begins its search dividing the list into two halves. 
First, the first half is searched for the required number and if found, the other half is rejected and vice versa.
The search continues until the number is foundor the subarray size becomes zero.
